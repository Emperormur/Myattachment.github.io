          <h3> Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
          <p> " Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
            did no diappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, In particular, was outstanding. It took my learing to the next levelin a way that no tutorial
            could have. In fact, I've often refered to it during interviews as an example of my development 
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full stack developer after recieving multiple offers
            100% recommended. </p>
